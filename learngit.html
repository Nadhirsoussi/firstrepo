            <p>
                Eminem is an American rapper, record producer and actor known as one of the most controversial and best-selling artists of the early 21st century. Who Is Eminem? Rapper, actor and music producer Eminem is one of the best-selling musicians of the 21st century and one of the most influential rappers of all time. Born Marshall Bruce Mathers III in 1972 in Missouri, Eminem had a turbulent childhood. He dropped out of school in the ninth grade and worked odd jobs until finally making it as a rapper upon the release of The Slim Shady LP in early 1999. The album went multi-platinum, garnering Eminem two Grammy Awards and four MTV Video Music Awards. In 2000, Eminem released The Marshall Mathers LP, which was noted as the fastest-selling album in rap history. Two years later, he delivered the Academy Award-winning song "Lose Yourself," from the semi-autobiographical drama 8 Mile. In 2010, he released the Grammy-winning album Recovery, a highly autobiographical attempt to come to terms with his struggles with addiction and experience with rehabilitation. The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013) also garnered numerous accolades, and the rapper later followed with Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018) and Music to Be Murdered By (2020).

            <h3>1. The Marshall Mathers LP (2000)</h3>
            <p>
                
                Eminem was the most compelling when his lyrics nailed a Venn diagram’s center of brilliant fiction and ugly facts, personal grudges and public battles, the imagination of a grindhouse pervert and the appeal of a pop star. With The Marshall Mathers LP critics waged war about whether he was a leaking toxic barrel of homophobia and misogyny, or the gifted Bob Dylan of the trailer park. The Marshall Mathers LP featured the vivid “Stan,” maybe the only storytelling rap to rival the greatness of Slick Rick’s “Children’s Story,” and it also features self-consciously antagonistic needling of “Fuck, shit, ass, bitch, cunt, shooby-de-doo-wop/ Skibbedy-be-bop-a-Christopher-Reeves.”
                
                Here, Eminem was a tabloid dream pretending to be middle America’s nightmare. His personal life was on display in ways that were both uncomfortable and intriguing in the pre-TMZ era, taking shots at his mother, the media, and people that bother him when he’s eating. And then, of course, there’s “Kim,” a Wagnerian scream-therapy session where he kills his ex on record … for the second time. In its worst light, “Kim” is a misogynistic attack directed at a real person without a recording contract to defend herself; in its best light it’s “Stagger Lee” gone Lars Von Trier, complete with the anti-hero unraveling into distraction, self-loathing, and flickering memories.

            <h3>2. The Slim Shady LP (1999)</h3>
            <p>
                
                The slimy finger that Wet Willie’d America. Bratty and beastie, Eminem’s major-label debut was an instant sensation thanks to its smarmy pop cultural fricassees, its needling shock-raps, three quirky singles produced by gangsta ambassador Dr. Dre, and a macabre piece of outlaw rap about abandoning his babymama’s body in a lake. With a Barnum-esque sell and the twisted shoxploitation of early Wes Craven, Eminem’s lines about being a lightning rod for controversy promptly became a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, The Slim Shady LP’s real triumph obviously wasn’t in its Spice Girl jokes and misogynistic gross-outs; it was in artistically flipping the script of rap bravado, twisting the “you ain’t shit” posturing of L.L. Cool J and Kool Moe Dee to the “I ain’t shit” posturing of Woody Allen and Rodney Dangerfield. Leave not being a joke to Rakim: The Slim Shady character is a compulsive masturbator, an addict, an ungrateful prick to his fans, a skinny, broke, short-tempered, jealous bad influence who spits when he talks, hates his job, and brags about genital warts, herpes, syphilis, “full-blown AIDS and a sore throat.” On the more venomous moments, he lashes out at his deadbeat dad, his middle-school bully, his ex-girlfriend, his mom — even earning a pair of lawsuits down the road. As a white boy, Eminem came from outside the walls of hip-hop culture, but he ultimately used its storytelling methods to tell of his own reality.

            <h3> 3. The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013)</h3>
            <p>
            
                If there’s a more purely technical rap album, I haven’t heard it. This showboat-y, athletic collection of stunt raps is the hip-hop that Grandmaster Caz, Big Daddy Kane, and Kool G Rap knew: syllable science, a pissing contest of tricky combinations and assonant hurdle-jumping taking out all rookies. By 2013, rap styles had evolved to include the street-level reportage of Kendrick Lamar, the DIY minimalism of Chief Keef, the melodic gargle of Future, the sing-song of Drake, and the flow-hopping chaos of Young Thug. But if you’re of the age to appreciate a good Kwamé joke (“Love Game”) then this album is nothing short of remarkable. Here, a pop star turns into the Buckethead or DJ QBert of rap, pushing his instrument to fantastic limits, spilling over the edges. Rick Rubin is at the decks for the first time, walking the way of looped rock samples courtesy of Joe Walsh, Zombies, Billy Squier, and Wayne Fontana. “So Far…” is probably his best post-rehab solo joint, an “old rapper yells at cloud” track where Em hilariously documents his frustration with computers, fans pointing out his crow’s feet, and the next generation of Slim Shadys. “Headlights” is probably his most sober and honest song ever, a heartbreaking apology to his mother for years of cleaning his lyrical closet. If you can stomach the occasional “rapping as Yoda” moment or treacley Skylar Grey chorus, MMLP2 is a phenomenal example of “rappity rap” that, in the case of one song, literally broke a Guinness record.

            <h3> 4. The Eminem Show (2002) </h3>
            <p>
               
                The third part of Eminem’s classic major-label run is where he emerges from frolicking inside the media hall of mirrors and starts simply saying reality bites, talking openly about court cases that have been long forgotten and beefs that have been long abandoned. It’s a little self-serious and self-righteous, with songs like “Sing For The Moment” and “My Dad’s Gone Crazy” about the healing power of his own music. Eminem really took the reigns as a producer for the first time — he’s got sole or co-producer credits on all but the three Dr. Dre songs — and he really leans towards martial, leaden, overdramatized beats. Still, he remained a beastly rhymer, able to freely toss out bonkers lines like “I’m interesting, the best thing since wrestling/ Infesting in your kids’ ears and nesting” or “full of controversy until I retire my jersey/ Till the fire inside dies and expires at 30.” It’s all basically an album-length run-up to “Lose Yourself,” where Em is no longer a psycho jackoff but instead a focused soldier and a Superman, where he’d rather rap over an Aerosmith ballad than a slinky, quirky Labi Siffre organ riff. It has “Cleaning Out My Closet,” the raw point-by-point diss song at his own mother (he says he won’t perform it anymore), and the deliriously goofy “Without Me,” whose interpolation of fellow heavily criticized white interloper Malcolm McClaren’s “Buffalo Gals” was either pure genius or hilarious coincidence.
